Each job application is stored in a subcollection named `jobApplications` under its respective job posting. This design enforces Authorization Independence by keeping applications directly associated with their parent job postings and avoids the need for authorization `get()` calls. The `jobPostingId` field within `JobApplication` further strengthens this relationship. A new top-level collection `m365Inquiries` is added to store contact form submissions for M365 licensing. This isolates sensitive contact data into its own collection, which will have strict security rules to allow public writes but deny all reads, protecting user privacy."
